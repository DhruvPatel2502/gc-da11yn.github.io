## Persona

### About the creation of our persona

The main goal of creating these personas was to better understand our target audience. By developing a greater understanding of our users. By developing a greater understanding of our users, we would be able to build a responsive site architecture for all existing and future content hosted on the Digital Accessibility Toolkit’s website.

To do this we must:

- Define our audience,
- Understand their specific goals and needs,
- Discover the relationship between the site’s content and the audiences’ goals and needs.

### Framework

Our approach is modular: we combined two types of persona to create a template that better represents our target audience. We used the two following framework:

#### Target user persona

- Focuses on the goal and needs of the average user

#### Accessibility persona

- Identifies the frustrations people living with disabilities and/or limitation face when using inaccessible products.

### Disability types and inclusivity

In our personas, we included a variety of disabilities and a spectrum of limitations:
• Permanent disabilities
• Temporary limitations
• Situational disabilities/limitations

We believe it is important to account for a wide range of human experiences. This is why for each disability type we included different possibilities of exclusion.

### Seven (7) Persona
